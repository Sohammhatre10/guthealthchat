What is the gut microbiome and why is it important?The term \u201cgut microbiome\u201d refers to the microorganisms living in your intestines. Each person has about 200 different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in their digestive tract.Some microorganisms are harmful to our health, but many are incredibly beneficial and even necessary for a healthy body.Research indicates that having a large variety of bacteria in the gut may help reduce the risk of conditions like: diabetesinflammatory bowel disease (IBD)psoriatic arthritisIn other words, your gut health is often related to your overall health.How does the gut microbiome affect your health?The incredible complexity of the gut and its importance to our overall health is a topic of increasing research in the medical community. Research over the past few decades has found links between gut health and:mental health disordersautoimmune diseasesendocrine conditionsgastrointestinal disorderscardiovascular diseasecancerA higher level of diversity in gut bacteria may be associated with improved general mental and physical health. Share on PinterestProcessed and sugary foods may impact the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in your gut. Jeremy Pawlowski/Stocksy United7 signs of an unhealthy gutMany parts of modern life can affect your gut microbiome, including:high stress levelstoo little sleepeating a Western diet high in processed and sugary foodstaking antibioticsThis in turn may affect other aspects of your health, such as:immune functionhormone levelsweightdevelopment of diseasesYou may notice a few symptoms if you have reduced gut health. Here are seven of the most common signs:1. Upset stomach Stomach disturbances can all be signs of an unhealthy gut. They include:gasbloatingconstipationdiarrheaheartburnA balanced gut will have less difficulty processing food and eliminating waste, likely leading to fewer symptoms.2. A high-sugar dietA diet high in processed foods and added sugars can decrease the amount of \u201cgood\u201d bacteria and diversity in your gut. Research suggests that eating too much sugar may lead to increased inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation can be the precursor to several diseases, including cancer.If you eat high amounts of sugar, your gut health may be compromised.3. Unintentional weight changesGaining or losing weight without changing your diet or exercise habits may be a sign of an unhealthy gut. An imbalanced gut can impair your body\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients, regulate blood sugar, and store fat.Weight loss may be caused by malabsorption because of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). On the other hand, weight gain may be caused by insulin resistance or increased inflammation.4. Sleep disturbances or constant fatigueResearch indicates that an imbalance in gut bacteria may be linked to fragmented sleep and short sleep duration, which may lead to chronic fatigue. While the cause remains unclear, it appears to be connected to inflammation, metabolic function, and mental health.5. Skin irritationSkin conditions like psoriasis may be related to the types of bacteria present in the gut. Lower concentrations of beneficial bacteria may impact the body\u2019s immune system and your skin health. 6. Autoimmune conditionsMany studies have found connections between the gut and the immune system. An unhealthy gut may increase systemic inflammation and alter the proper functioning of the immune system. This may lead to autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself mistaking its cells and organs for harmful invaders.7. Food intolerancesFood intolerances are the result of difficulty digesting certain foods. This is different than a food allergy, which is caused by an immune system reaction to certain foods.Research indicates that food intolerances, like lactose intolerance, may be caused by poor quality of bacteria in the gut. This can lead to trouble digesting the trigger foods and symptoms like:bloatinggasdiarrheaabdominal painnauseaThere is also some research indicating that food allergies may be related to gut health. 7 things you can do for your gut healthYou may be able to improve and reset your gut health through lifestyle and diet changes. Consider trying one or more of the following to improve your gut health naturally:1. Lower your stress levels Chronic high levels of stress are hard on your whole body, including your gut. This is because your body releases certain hormones when it experiences stress. High levels of these hormones affect your body and may compromise gut health.A few ways to lower stress may include:meditatingwalkinggetting a massagespending time with friends or familydiffusing essential oilslimiting alcohol intakelaughingpracticing yogaspending time with a pet2. Get enough sleepNot getting enough or sufficient quality of sleep may have serious impacts on your gut health, which can in turn contribute to more sleep issues.Try to prioritize getting at least 7\u20138 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night. Your doctor may be able to help if you have trouble sleeping.3. Eat slowlyChewing your food thoroughly and eating your meals more slowly may lower your chances of developing obesity and diabetes while also helping you make better food choices. This may help you reduce digestive discomfort and maintain a healthy gut.4. Stay hydratedDrinking plenty of water may be linked to increased diversity of bacteria in the gut, though the source of the water also matters. One 2022 study also found that people who drank more water had less of a type of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal infections.Staying hydrated benefits your health overall and can help prevent constipation. It may also be a simple way to promote a healthy gut.5. Take a prebiotic or probioticWhile research is ongoing, adding a prebiotic or probiotic supplement to your diet may help improve your gut health. Prebiotics provide \u201cfood\u201d meant to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, while probiotics are live good bacteria.People who have a severe illness or a weakened immune system should not take probiotics. Also, not all probiotic supplements are high quality or beneficial for your health. It\u2019s best to speak with a healthcare professional when choosing a probiotic or prebiotic supplement to help improve your health.6. Check for food intolerancesYou may have a food intolerance if you have symptoms such as:bloatingabdominal paindiarrheagasnauseafatigueacid refluxYou can try eliminating common trigger foods to see if your symptoms improve. If you\u2019re able to identify and avoid a food or foods that are contributing to your symptoms, you may see a positive change in your digestive health. 7. Change your dietReducing the amount of processed, sugary, and high fat foods that you eat may lead to better gut health.Eating a diet high in fiber likely contributes to a healthy gut microbiome as well. You may also positively impact your gut by eating foods high in micronutrients called polyphenols present in:vegetablesfruitscoffeeteawine 4 types of food for gut healthDiet and gut health appear to be very closely linked. Avoiding processed foods, high fat foods, and foods high in refined sugars is likely important for maintaining a healthy microbiome, as these foods may promote the growth of damaging bacteria.You can eat certain foods that actively promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, contributing to your overall health. These superfoods for gut health include:1. High fiber foodsResearch indicates that high fiber foods have a positive impact on gut health. These foods include:legumes, like black beans and chickpeaswhole grains, like oats and quinoavegetables, like broccoli and asparagusnuts, like almonds and pistachiosfruits, like apples and peaches2. GarlicAccording to a 2019 study in rodents, garlic may increase gut microbiome diversity and improve gut health. A small 2018 study of 49 people similarly found that aged garlic extract increased diversity and levels of beneficial bacteria. Still, more research in humans should be done.3. Fermented foodsFermented foods are great dietary sources of probiotics. Examples include:kimchisauerkrautyogurtkefirResearch suggests that consuming these foods may improve the gut microbiome.4. Collagen-boosting foodsCollagen-rich foods such as bone broth and salmon skin may be beneficial for both overall health and gut health. A 2021 study indicated that supplements with collagen may benefit the gut microbiome in mice, though further research is needed.You could also try to boost your body\u2019s collagen production through your diet. To help your body make collagen, try eating more:citrus fruitsbroccolimeateggsnutsFrequently asked questionsWhy does the gut microbiome vary in individuals?The gut microbiome is affected by many factors, including:dietenvironmentantibiotic usestresssleepgeneticsEach of these elements varies in different people, influencing their gut microbiomes in different ways. This variation results in individuals having unique gut microbiomes.How does the gut microbiome respond to fasting?Fasting seems to benefit the gut microbiome, though more research in humans needs to be done.According to one small 2019 study of 16 people, fasting was linked to lower levels of a bacteria that promotes colorectal cancer.Research in animals also shows the benefits of fasting. A 2018 study in fruit flies found that intermittent fasting appeared to improve gut health and increase lifespan. Another 2019 study in mice indicated that fasting promoted the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and reduced inflammation in the intestines.Does eating probiotics actually change your gut microbiome?Some studies have found no impact of probiotics on the gut microbiome. Still, other research suggests that probiotics may significantly affect the makeup of the gut microbiome and positively impact other areas of health, like immunity. Studies are still being done in this area.How can I improve my gut health?You can improve your gut health by taking steps to improve your overall health. This can include eating more fiber-rich foods, eating fewer ultra-processed foods, getting enough sleep, and managing your stress levels.What are the signs of an unhealthy gut?Some signs of unbalanced gut bacteria can include upset stomach, unintentional weight changes, and fatigue. TakeawayThe human gut is complex. While research is ongoing, it seems clear that the gut microbiome impacts whole-body health. A healthy gut contributes to:a strong immune systemheart healthbrain healthimproved moodhealthy sleepeffective digestionpotential prevention of some cancers and autoimmune diseasesLifestyle and dietary changes may positively affect not only your gut health but your overall health."

The key takeaway: Gut health goes hand in hand with brain health. In this excerpt, Dr. Nandi provides in-depth lists of the best foods for gut health, along with explanations of why they are important, whether it\u2019s leafy greens, certain spices or cheese. Taking action on the information that Dr. Nandi provides may be key to preventing brain problems such as stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.How to change your gut healthDespite all the things that can go wrong with our gut and all the ways we can damage our GI tract, there are a lot of ways we can help things go right as well as actions we can take to heal or improve the GI system. Remember my story about the benefits of children eating dirt? Every time we enjoy a meal\u2014be it french fries and a hamburger, or kale and black-eyed peas\u2014we potentially change our microbiome. How we make that change is up to us, but for healthy change to occur, we must want to do it.Change, as most of us know, can be hard to sustain. But when a new habit has a purpose that we value\u2014such as charging a treasured videogame player or eating food that supports the health of our body and brain\u2014it\u2019s much easier. The best way to make something a habit is to have a goal that is important to you, and few goals in life are more important than saving our brain.Make it a habit! Four tips to improve gut health\nDo not eat out more than once a week.\nTry to avoid processed foods and limit them to no more than 25 percent of your meals.\nConsume organic, non-GMO foods as often as possible.\nEat with someone\u2014dinners with family and friends help build the pillar of community.Stop being so SADThere is a reason why the typical diet of a US citizen is called the Standard American Diet, SAD for short. Consuming primarily calorie-dense and nutrient-poor foods and beverages means eating a lot of \u201cbad\u201d fats and carbohydrates, not to mention large amounts of additives and pesticides, with little room for beneficial foods. When it comes to changing gut health, we all need to try to switch to a primarily plant-based way of eating. Even a minor change will immediately impact your gut health, so do your best to eat more:Vegetables, particularly leafy green and cruciferous ones.\nAlliums, like garlic and onions.\nSpices.\nFermented foods.\nBerries.Research has shown that plant-based foods are generally higher in the nutrients that increase the levels of beneficial bacteria in the gut while decreasing harmful strains of bacteria, not to mention packed with vitamins and minerals. Let\u2019s take a closer look.Leafy greens. Leafy green vegetables offer nutrients like folate, vitamin C, vitamin K, and vitamin A and are tasty sources of fiber. Examples include cabbage, lettuce, and kale. Several studies have shown that these foods contain a \u201cgood\u201d carb called sulfoquinovose, which supports the growth of healthy gut bacteria. Thus, leafy greens help to build a healthy microbiome.Cruciferous vegetables. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, radishes, kale, bok choy, and cauliflower can be eaten raw or cooked. Either way they are incredibly nutritious, supplying protein, good carbohydrates, and vitamins (especially vitamin A, vitamin C, and folic acid) and minerals including iron, calcium, selenium, copper, manganese, and zinc. For example, 1 cup of cauliflower has 3 grams of fiber, which is 10 percent of what you need each day to feed the healthy bacteria in your gut, optimize colon function, and reduce inflammation, all things that promote digestive health.Allium vegetables. If you ask me, everything tastes better with garlic, so add a little more whenever you are preparing savory foods. A study in Food Science and Human Wellness showed that garlic supports the proliferation of \u201cgood\u201d gut bacteria (Bifidobacteria, for example) and prevents harmful bacteria from growing. Garlic is rich in inulin, a type of nondigestible carbohydrate that acts as food for the favorable bacteria in your digestive system. Raw garlic is best for gut health, as it loses its prebiotic benefits the more you cook the garlic.Spices. Equally important are spices. Take ginger, for instance. We may think of it as something commonly used to flavor cookies, but it is delicious in savory foods as well and has many medicinal properties. Ginger can help relieve nausea, vomiting, and other stomach-related symptoms. In a study published in the journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology, researchers found that ginger can increase our levels of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances. Prostaglandins function to increase the ability of the gut lining to absorb more of the nutrients our bodies need. There are also compounds found in ginger called gingerols. These have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, which may be why this spice works so well on digestion problems.Fermented foods. While you are making changes to heal your gut, be sure to add the fermented foods mentioned earlier and the pre-, pro-, and postbiotics they contain to your daily diet. Food that has undergone fermentation\u2014where yeast or bacteria break down the sugars they contain\u2014include:Cheeses that have been aged but not pasteurized or heated, including cheddar, Swiss, provolone, Gouda, Edam, and Gruyere.\nCottage cheese.\nHoney (raw).\nKefir.\nKimchi.\nKombucha.\nSauerkraut.\nTempeh.\nYogurt.Berries. Fruit is always an excellent choice, and berries are the best. In my clinical experience, most berries help chronic inflammation and improve gut bacteria. Berries are among the healthiest foods available and are an excellent alternative to sugary snacks. Consume a few servings of berries every week and experiment with different varieties.Eight of the top berries for gut health are:A\u00e7ai berries\nBilberries\nBlueberries\nCranberries\nGoji berries\nGrapes (yes, grapes are berries!)\nRaspberries\nStrawberriesIf you do only one thing to improve gut health If you do only one thing to improve your gut health, that thing should be to find your kitchen!Even if you cannot go vegan or give up the occasional cheeseburger, preparing your own food can radically change your gut and your brain. You may have read that the populations of countries like India and China historically have far less cognitive impairment and decline than is seen in the West. This may in part be due to using turmeric and cumin in cooking in these countries. Also, preparing foods at home and eating more whole foods is ingrained in these cultures\u2014not because they have read about it in a book, but because this is their habit, their way of life, passed on from generation to generation.Sadly, that is now changing, because fast-food restaurants with their menus of processed foods are everywhere around the world. The convenience and allure of prepared and hyperpalatable foods, easily accessible and often affordable, make the spread of these unhealthy options almost unavoidable. To preserve cognitive and gut health, we must counteract the effective marketing of these disease-causing foods.That is why preparing your own food is so important. Not only does food taste better when you make it, but it changes your entire understanding and approach to eating. I involve my kids in this process. They think the food tastes even better when they help, and they enjoy the experience. The entire family\u2014our little community at home\u2014works together to solve problems creating our meals. When we then sit down together to enjoy the fruits of our labor, our tribe helps to solidify our health, one meal at a time, the health hero way.An excerpt from Heal Your Gut, Save Your Brain by Partha Nandi, M.D., F.A.C.P.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevant reading\nSharp\nWhat if your best days weren\u2019t left to chance, but something you could control and activate at will?\u00a0Most of us want to be a little happier, a little more focused, and a lot less stressed.
